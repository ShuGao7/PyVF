PyVF is an open-source program to extract significant vertical features (VFs) from a high-resolution, bare-earth LiDAR-DEM automatically.

## Definition
Vertical features are raised linear features such as roadbeds, railroads, levees, floodwalls, and natural features that alter the path of inundation (Bilskie et al., 2015).

### Target Recognition
This process traversed each DEM cell andÂ extracted all potential VF raster cells (i.e., high enough) based on terrain analysis for each DEM cell in eight directions by a iterative increasing size moving window method.

### Target Delineation
This process is to covert the potential VF raster cells into polyline combined with hydrologic analysis.
