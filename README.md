# PyVF

PyVF is an open-source program to extract significant vertical features (VFs) from a high-resolution, bare-earth LiDAR-DEM automatically.

## Definition
Vertical features are raised linear features such as roadbeds, railroads, levees, floodwalls, and natural features that alter the path of inundation (Bilskie et al., 2015).
